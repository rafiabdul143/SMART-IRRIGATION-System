 # Smart Irrigation System
## Prerequisites
- **Arduino IDE**: You need to have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. You can download it from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
 
## Key Components
- **Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)**: The brain of the system, processing data and controlling actions.
- **Moisture Sensor**: Monitors soil moisture levels, helping the system determine when irrigation is needed.
- **Servo Motor**: Takes input from the microcontroller (Arduino Uno) to control the direction of water flow based on real-time moisture data.
- **Relay Module**: Powers the water pump on and off, automating irrigation.
- **Jumper Wires & Battery**: Ensures seamless connections and provides power to the system.
- **Breadboard**: Used for prototyping the circuit, allowing for easy connections and modifications without soldering.

## Software
I used the **Arduino IDE** to integrate the software code with the hardware, bringing this project to life. The system continuously reads the temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels, and activates the pump when the moisture level drops below a certain threshold. 

## Source Code 
The source code for the Smart Irrigation System is provided in this repository.
